What is the TOH Zero?
The TOH LAB Zero is an open source Budget 3D printer, Built for Speed and Details

Why another Budget 3D printer?
Many people want a 3D printer to crank out the fastest speedbenchy, but to do this you need a specialized 3D printer that is build for speed and speed only, This usually costs a hefty amount AND after a couple prints, it sits dormant. This is where the TOH Zero comes in, it has a hot-swappable toolheadm, so you can seamlessly transistion from speed to detail without having to permanently keep your printer on one of the two. The exact detail of the printer makes it perfect for printing Minitures and other small scale models that would be impossible on your average printer, yet when you simply switch out the toolhead, it can become a speed demon. The best thing is you can source all the parts yourself, creating either a high quality machine, or a budget printer for less then $100
