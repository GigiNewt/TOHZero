# What is the TOH Zero & What does it cost?
The TOH LAB Zero is an open source Budget 3D printer, Built for Speed and Details. It costs nothing to gain all plans and files for the printer, But donations are very welcome



# What are the specifications?
The specifications will vary depending on the components you decide to use and the model of the TOH Zero you decide to build, generally the printer will have a 70mm×70mm×120mm Build area, this is perfect for most minitures, small, detailed components, or a speedbenchy.



# Why another Budget 3D printer?
Many people want a 3D printer to crank out the fastest speedbenchy, but to do this you need a specialized 3D printer that is build for speed and speed only, This usually costs a hefty amount AND after a couple prints, it sits dormant. This is where the TOH Zero comes in, it has a hot-swappable toolhead, so you can seamlessly transistion from speed to detail without having to permanently keep your printer on one of the two. The exact detail of the printer makes it perfect for printing Minitures and other small scale models that would be impossible on your average printer, yet when you simply switch out the toolhead, it can become a speed demon. The best thing is you can source all the parts yourself, creating either a high quality machine, or a budget printer for less then $100



# Is it upgradable?
Yes the TOH Zero is very upgradable, your printer is fully customisable, you can source all the parts to fit your needs, due the the amount of 3d printed parts on the Zero, it is easy to swap out the colour of your parts, and experiment with different types of filaments. The printer is open source, meaning you and others can make upgrades for the printer with ease.



# When will it become available?
The printer is planned to become available later this year, a more specific date will be out soon
